2. Open the Freighter project located inside **Freighter** folder by going to menu **FILE > Open > Project/Solution** and selecting **Freighter.sln**.

Setting Up the Web API Project Properties

1. Once the solution is opened to set up the Web API project, select the **Freighter.API** project in the Solution Explorer section.
3.  Right click on the project and select properties.
4. In the properties window, select the **Web** tab and select 
	* Start Action: "Don't open a page. Wait for request from an external application."
	* Servers: Local IIS
	* Once the two options are selected, click "Create Virtual Directory".
5. Hit **Ctrl + S** to save all the changes and **Ctrl + F4** to close the properties window.

####How to Set Up IIS
Setting Up Freighter.Api

1. Open IIS 7 Manager.
2. [Enable the Application Pool to run 32-bit applications](https://help.webcontrolcenter.com/kb/a1114/how-to-enable-32-bit-application-pool-iis-7-dedicatedvps.aspx)  so the site can work properly because the FTP third party DLL is 32-bit.
3. [Enable Anonymous Authentication](http://www.iis.net/configreference/system.webserver/security/authentication/anonymousauthentication) (for OPTIONS API request, authorization for OPTIONS is set in web.config).
4. Enable Windows Authentication.
5. (Optional) If working with functionality that needs to reach out to the Aesop DB, you will need to get the credentials for the corp\svc_st_dev_web service account so the application has the correct permissions to access the appropriate DB.
	* You will need to go into the IIS site to determine which Application Pool you're running as (under Advanced Settings of the site).
	* Once you have the Application Pool name, go into Application Pools and select the one you are running as.
	* Click advanced settings -> Identity option -> Custom Account and use the corp\svc_st_dev_web account credentials.
	* In production, this will get configured with the proper account on the IIS server this project is running on.
	
Setting Up Freighter.App

1. Enable Anonymous Authentication because the first call this app makes is to get the current user information from the API which requires authentication. We do this so that the user doesn't have to authenticate twice.

####Required third party DLL registration 
Note: This is a pre-build step. This part might not be necessary

* The FTP DLL (SFTPCOMInterface.dll) must be registered on every machine this app runs on
	* The Octopus Deploy step handles this when deploying. 
	* It needs to be done locally, even if you don't want to use the FTP functionality.   
	* http://help.globalscape.com/help/gs_com_api/com_remotely_administering_eft_server_using_the_com_api.htm#register

#### Testing FTP functionality
* To test FTP in a local env, download and install EFT Enterprise Edition without SQL Server from http://www.globalscape.com/support/eft.aspx
